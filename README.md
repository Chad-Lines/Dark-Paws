# Dark-Paws


##About
Dark Paws is a simple retro-style arcade game - the first game that I ever published (both to web and Android), and offered a great opportunity to collaborate, and prove my skills in programming and animation. 

Dark Paws was also the first program that I ever published to Mobile. Since it's not a native mobile app,  I was presented with the unique and exciting challenge of teaching myself how to use tools like CocoonJS to take the project from a computer monitor to a touch-based mobile screen.
